## About Me

I'm a second year Master in Machine Learning (MSML) student at Carnegie Mellon University. 
I'm fortunate to be advised by [Barnabás Póczos](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~bapoczos/) and [Pradeep Ravikumar](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pradeepr/).
My research interests span theory and application sides of machine learning, including **representation learning theory** and **AI4Science**. 
In representation learning theory, I'm interested in finding good features that are controllable and interpretable. 
Currently, I'm working on representation learning for various modalities and tasks, especially tabular data and anomaly detection
In AI4Science, I mainly work on AI for molecule generation and optimization using generative models.

I received my Bachelor's degree in computer science and mathematical science (double major) from the University of Michigan,
where I was advised by [Dr. Henry Liu](https://cee.engin.umich.edu/people/liu-henry/) in [Michigan Traffic Lab](https://traffic.engin.umich.edu/home).
During my time at MTL, I worked on traffic data processing and traffic state prediction/estimation.

Should you share similar interests or consider potential collaboration, please feel free to reach out to me at chenhao4@andrew.cmu.edu or zhangch9012@gmail.com. 
I’d love to engage in discussions and explore opportunities for collaboration.
